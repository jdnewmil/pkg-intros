Short package discussions

These materials were prepared for a meeting of the East Bay R Beginners Meetup Group in Oakland on 2-Apr-2019.

## DiagrammeR

The _DiagrammeR_ package allows incremental or programmatically-generated node/edge graphs to be drawn. It also supports interaction diagrams that are useful for conveying sequential interactions between people and software, or between different software components.


## dygraph

The _dygraph_ package allows you to embed interactive time series plots into an otherwise static web page, or in a dynamic (Shiny) web page.
